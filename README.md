# LN-DOS
Custom OS currently in development

short term TODO list:
- decimal print
- terminal scrolling even when the vram is full
- memory manager: find out how more memory block pages are going to be allocated
- floppy and fat12 driver, overcome the 64k kernel memsize barrier.
- init program
- context switching
